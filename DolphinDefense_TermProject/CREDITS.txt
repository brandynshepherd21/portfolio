SOURCE CODE

	-Some external resources were used in order to understand Cocos2d
	 syntax (which is what Spritebuilder uses). Programming Dolphin
	 Defense was made possible because of two online tutorials that I
	 completed. Both tutorials were provided by www.makeschool.com.
	
	-The first tutorial, Peeved Penguins, can be found at this
	 URL: https://www.makeschool.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-spritebuilder/

	-The second tutorial, Flappy Fly, can be found at this
	 URL: https://www.makeschool.com/gamernews/369/build-your-own-flappy-bird-with-spritebuilder-and?source=mgwu

	-Also, I must thank my wonderful instructor, Dr. Yang. It was only because
	 of this class, that I was able to utilize Xcode effectively. Thank you! :)
